# Calculator
 An android app which not only includes basic mathematics or some scientfic  functions, but also, conversion of number system

###Functionalities:
####Basic and some scientific mathematics (working phase)
####Number coversion system (almost completed)

### Passed Testcases:
* 1 + 2 = 3
* 1.1 + 2.2 = 3.3
* 2.2 -1.1 = 1.1
* 2 * 3 = 6.0
* 3 / 4 = 0.75
* 3 + 2 - 1 = 4
* sin30 = -0.988
* sin30*4 = -3.952
* cos30 = 0.1542
* sin(21+9) = -0.988
* log(10+90) = 2
* log(log(100+900)) = 0.477
